# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current expense tracker application experiences performance issues when making OpenAI API calls for receipt processing and expense categorization. These synchronous calls block the request thread, causing slow response times and poor user experience. This feature aims to optimize OpenAI API performance through asynchronous operations, background task processing, and improved error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user uploading receipts, I want the upload process to be fast and responsive, so that I don't have to wait for AI processing to complete before seeing confirmation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a receipt file THEN the system SHALL return an immediate response confirming the upload
2. WHEN AI processing is initiated THEN the system SHALL process the receipt data in the background without blocking the API response
3. WHEN background processing completes THEN the system SHALL update the expense data with extracted information
4. IF AI processing fails THEN the system SHALL still allow manual expense creation with the uploaded receipt

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user creating expenses with AI categorization, I want the expense creation to be fast, so that the interface remains responsive during AI processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests AI categorization THEN the system SHALL use async operations to prevent blocking
2. WHEN AI categorization is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback to the user
3. WHEN AI categorization completes THEN the system SHALL update the expense with the suggested category
4. IF AI categorization fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to a default category without failing the expense creation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the OpenAI service to use connection pooling and async operations, so that multiple concurrent requests can be handled efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple OpenAI requests are made concurrently THEN the system SHALL handle them using async HTTP client with connection pooling
2. WHEN OpenAI API rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN OpenAI service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality without crashing
4. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the system SHALL limit concurrent OpenAI requests to prevent resource exhaustion

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the status of AI processing for my receipts, so that I know when the automated data extraction is complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a receipt is uploaded THEN the system SHALL provide a processing status indicator
2. WHEN AI processing is in progress THEN the system SHALL show "processing" status
3. WHEN AI processing completes successfully THEN the system SHALL show "completed" status with extracted data
4. WHEN AI processing fails THEN the system SHALL show "failed" status with error information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper monitoring and logging of OpenAI API performance, so that I can identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OpenAI API calls are made THEN the system SHALL log response times and success rates
2. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
3. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL log rate limit events for monitoring
4. WHEN background tasks fail THEN the system SHALL log task failures with context information
